#Introduction:
Our project will focus on the Mental Health of Students.

##Company/background:
Higher Institution, 

##Current Systems(s) procedures:


##Problem Statement:
Students get Overwhelmed by school and most of them battle Mental Health on their own. Institutions have services or helplines
that assist Students with Mental issues through Psycological interventions.
Most Students are not open with their Mental issues and sometimes find it hard to consult every time.

##Proposed Solution:
The Mind/Matter app focuses on giving the Students a platform where they can assist themselves, 
having the psychologist monitoring the Student's progress.
