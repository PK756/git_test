# Introduction:
In College, Mental health is common Amongst Students, not only caused by Academics but also lack of Social life.
According to mental health research conducted by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), one in four students has a diagnosable mental illness
Our project will focus on solving these issues.

## Company/background:
MIND/MATTER offers a broad spectrum of psychological and educational services to UJ students and staff, as well as the wider community.
MIND/MATTERâ€™s services aim to enhance the psychological fitness of clients to manage personal life challenges, increase productivity, and to optimize their performance.

## Current Systems(s) procedures:
Systems like "What's up", MoodFit, MoodMission, e.t.c, have similar concepts, but a common floor in most of these apps is that they do not cater for little kids and those who prefer Audios,
for sometimes I would like to listen to an audio while doing whatever the audio suggests. With Most of them you are not monitored by anyone

## Problem Statement:
Students get Overwhelmed by school and most of them battle Mental Health on their own. Institutions have services or helplines
that assist Students with Mental issues through Psycological interventions.
Most Students are not open with their Mental issues and sometimes find it hard to consult every time.

## Proposed Solution:
The Mind/Matter app focuses on giving the Students a platform where they can assist themselves, 
having the psychologist monitoring the Student's progress.
